<!-- In JS, we learned different ways of creating templates to create an object, such as a factory and a construction function.
Now you've been invited to create a Person module that will have one constructor called Person and will have the following properties: firstName, lastName, and emailAddress.
Export your constructor function so that you can create three different objects in your index.js -->
